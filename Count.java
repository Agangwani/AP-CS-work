 * 2. the program is slightly easier to read, but makes little difference
 * 3. a single slash gives a syntax error that expects a second slash.
 * 4. no the two slashes
 * 5. i havent violated any guidlines, however, i could forget the semicolon
 * or i could have not forgotten to title the program
